# Rubik-Game
* The aim of the player is to press the squares of different colors from 4 different squares until the desired color covers all the squares.
* Color [] colors = new Color [5]; (We keep 5 colors.) We create 4 squares and assign a random color to each square.
* We find the square where the user wants to change the color from the coordinates of the place where the user clicks with the mouse.
* The color of the clicked square is randomly painted with one of the 5 colors we have determined.
* When all the squares are the same color, the game is completed with the text "You won".
* StdDraw.java and Rubik.java files should be under the same package.
